# Hi, I'm Cid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about building dynamic and scalable web applications. Currently, I work as a full-stack web developer with a focus on **PHP CodeIgniter** and the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 

Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work across various tech stacks and collaborate with different teams, which has allowed me to develop a diverse skill set. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and take on exciting challenges.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Let's build something amazing together!
